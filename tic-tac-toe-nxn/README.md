# Tic Tac Toe NxN

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, extended to support an NxN grid. Players can enjoy the game on a customizable board size, making it more challenging and fun.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `src/index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the Tic Tac Toe game, including a dynamic grid that adjusts based on the value of N.
- `src/style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the game, ensuring a visually appealing layout for the game board and UI elements.
- `src/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the game, initializing the board, handling player moves, checking for win conditions, and managing the game state.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe NxN game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tic-tac-toe-nxn
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**
   Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to start playing the game.

3. **Set the Value of N**
   You can customize the size of the game board by modifying the value of N in the JavaScript file (`src/app.js`). Look for the variable that defines the board size and change it to your desired value.

## How to Play

- Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid.
- The first player to align N marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
